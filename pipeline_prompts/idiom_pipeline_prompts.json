            "The idiom describes a mix of inexperience and poor planning leading to a bad outcome. Translating this visually: inexperienced staff can be represented as young, nervous or confused workers (e.g., people in casual or mismatched clothing, holding paperwork upside-down).

'Recipe for disaster' could be depicted as a kitchen scene where unqualified individuals attempt cooking, resulting in exaggerated chaos (e.g., smoke, spilled ingredients, broken utensils). This conveys the message with concrete elements."
